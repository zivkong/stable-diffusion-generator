# AI Assistant Notes

## Guidelines
- Always update the README file with any changes to the project structure, features, or development guidelines.
- Never use magic numbers; always define them as constants with meaningful names.
- Always use modular design to ensure code reusability and maintainability.
- Use a `.env` file to manage environment variables when it's suitable, such as for sensitive information or configuration settings.
- Ensure that `.env.sample` always reflects `.env` without values.
- Always clean up unused definitions, imports, constants, and enums when they are no longer being used.
- Always review the entire project based on guidelines before committing to git.
